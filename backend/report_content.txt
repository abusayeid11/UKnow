0.1. Executive Summary
UKnow is a novel Multi-Model Deep Learning System that revolutionizes the educational
experience by automating the creation and management of study material. The system integrates
three core AI pipelines to provide a holistic learning environment:
•Intelligent Generation:A pre-trained spaCy CNN-based NLP model (en core web sm)
is used for Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and depen-
dency parsing to automatically extract key concepts and generate contextual flashcards
from uploaded documents.
•AI-Enhanced Context:A Multi-Model Enhancement Module incorporates an extractive
summarization model for on-demand topic condensation and a Sequence-to-Sequence
(Seq2Seq) Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model with an attention mechanism to
break down language barriers.
•Predictive Analytics:The system closes the learning loop by providing personalized
performance analytics, recording user feedback, identifying weak topics, and generating
recommendations stored in a persistent UserHistory database.
This project successfully demonstrates the practical application of cutting-edge Deep Learn-
ing and NLP techniques to address fundamental student challenges: time-intensive manual
preparation and the lack of personalized feedback.
0.2. Introduction
0.2.1 Background
Traditional studying methods often lack personalization and fail to identify specific areas where
students struggle. Manual flashcard creation is time-consuming, and students may not effectively
track their weak points. The need for an intelligent, automated system that can extract key
concepts, generate study materials, and provide actionable feedback inspired the development
of UKnow.
0.2.2 Problem Statement
Students face several challenges in effective learning:
1. Time-intensive manual flashcard creation from lengthy documents.
2. Lack of personalized feedback on learning progress.
3. Difficulty identifying weak areas that require more focus.
4. Language barriers in understanding complex topics.
5. Absence of consolidated performance tracking across study sessions.
3
0.2.3 Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
•Develop an NLP-based system to automatically generate contextual flashcards from PDF
documents and text.
•Implement interactive study modes with real-time feedback mechanisms.
•Integrate summarization models to provide concise explanations of complex topics.
•Incorporate translation capabilities to overcome language barriers.
•Create a comprehensive performance tracking system with statistical analysis.
•Maintain historical data to enable review of previously weak topics.
0.3. Literature Review
0.3.1 Natural Language Processing in Education
Recent advances in NLP have enabled automatic content extraction and question generation
from educational materials. Techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-
Speech (POS) tagging, and dependency parsing allow systems to identify key concepts and
their relationships within text.
0.3.2 Spaced Repetition and Learning Analytics
Educational psychology research demonstrates that spaced repetition and performance tracking
significantly improve long-term retention. Digital flashcard systems enhanced with analytics
provide students with insights into their learning patterns.
0.3.3 Text Summarization Models
Abstractive and extractive summarization techniques using transformer-based models (e.g.,
BERT, GPT, T5) have shown remarkable performance in condensing complex information
while maintaining semantic meaning.
0.3.4 Neural Machine Translation
Modern Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems based on sequence-to-sequence archi-
tectures with attention mechanisms enable accurate cross-lingual content translation, making
educational materials accessible to diverse learners.

0.4. Methodology
0.4.1 System Architecture
The UKnow system follows a client-server architecture with four major modular components
communicating via a RESTful API (Flask). This decoupled design ensures the scalability of
the computationally intensive deep learning models.
Document Processing Module
•Accepts PDF files and plain text input.
•Extracts content using the PyPDF2 library.
•Cleans and normalizes text for downstream NLP processing.
NLP Flashcard Generation Module
•Utilizes a pre-trained CNN architecture: spaCy en core web sm.
•Performs Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract key terms.
•Uses dependency parsing to generate contextual questions and answers based on linguistic
term relationships.
Multi-Model Enhancement Module (Deep Learning Service)
•Houses the Summarization and Translation Models.
•Processes user requests for concise explanations and cross-lingual content conversion
during study sessions.
Performance Analytics Module
•Records user responses (correct/incorrect) for each flashcard.
•Calculates performance statistics, trends, and strength/weakness patterns.
•Stores historical data for longitudinal analysis and personalized recommendations.
0.4.2 Deep Learning Models Implemented
NLP Model for Flashcard Generation
•Model:spaCy en core web sm (CNN-based architecture optimized for speed).
•Task:Named Entity Recognition, POS tagging, dependency parsing.
•Input/Output:Raw text tokenized, segmented, and processed into structured flashcards
with terms, questions, and answers.

Text Summarization Model
•Approach:Extractive Summarization (low latency, future transformer upgrade possible).
•Purpose:Provide concise explanations on-demand.
Neural Machine Translation Model
•Architecture:Seq2Seq with attention mechanism.
•Solution for Accuracy:Glossary-based translation layer to preserve technical terms.
0.4.3 Database Schema
The system uses SQLite with Flask-SQLAlchemy ORM:
FlashcardSetset id (PK), title, created date, source type
Flashcardflashcard id (PK), set id (FK), term, question, answer, difficulty level
PerformanceRecordrecord id (PK), flashcard id (FK), response status, timestamp, session id
UserHistoryhistory id (PK), user id, weak topics (JSON), review dates, performance metrics
0.4.4 Implementation Workflow
1.Document Upload and Processing:Users upload PDF or text; backend extracts and
preprocesses content.
2.NLP-Based Flashcard Generation:spaCy extracts key terms and generates ques-
tions/answers.
3.Interactive Study Session:Users study flashcards, request summarization or translation;
responses recorded in real-time.
4.Performance Analysis:System aggregates responses, identifies weak areas, and gener-
ates personalized recommendations; historical data stored.
