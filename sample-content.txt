Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled training data to help predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Common examples include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.

Unsupervised Learning involves training algorithms on data without labels to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures. Popular techniques include K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly effective for image recognition tasks.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models to give computers the ability to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

The training process involves feeding the algorithm large amounts of data so it can learn to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each specific task. This process requires careful consideration of features, which are individual measurable properties of observed phenomena.

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, resulting in poor performance on new, unseen data. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to an independent dataset.

Artificial Neural Networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of nodes (neurons) connected by edges (synapses) that can transmit signals between neurons. The strength of these connections can be adjusted through learning algorithms.

Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating features from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. It often requires domain expertise and can significantly impact model performance.

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function in machine learning models by iteratively adjusting parameters in the direction of steepest descent of the objective function.
